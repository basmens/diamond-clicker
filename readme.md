### Bad fork usage
Please ignore the bad use of forking form a different project and then the first commits being 'cenverted project to diamond clicker', I was 15 at the time and relatively new to git.

# About
This project is the beginnings of a cookie clicker like game, where diamonds fall from the top of the screen and clicking gives money. Upgrades were meant to be present on the side. There are the four buttons that did get added at the top are functional however, though their contents might not be fully implemented.

# Contols
Clicking diamonds and interacting with UI is purely done using the mouse. The only exception is the escape key, it can close windows, and if none are open, it opens the options menu.

# How to run
1. Use git to clone this repo.
2. Open in any IDE. This should already do all the maven things for you
3. Run the ```DiamondClicker.java``` class

# Why
I made this project to study up more on design patterns. Specifically I wanted to learn the MVC pattern, but I also wanted to gain more affinity with patterns like Stategy. Although I did succeed in that, the project really could have benefitted form better design, use of generics, some global services perhaps or going to the next step and using dependency inversion to do a lot of heavy lifting. Furthermore, relying more on libraries to take care of specific tasks, for example a gui and big number library would've probably been a good idea.
